## **The "I-Don't-Care-But-Don't-Blame-Me" License**
* By reading, using, copying, modifying, or admiring these configuration files (hereafter referred to as "The Configs"), you hereby agree to the following terms:
* No Responsibility, No Refunds: I, the creator of The Configs, disclaim all responsibility for any outcome—even the hilariously catastrophic ones—that may result from using them. If your crypto trades become sentient and decide to run off with your life savings, that’s on you, buddy.
* No Warranty, Express or Implied: These Configs come with exactly zero guarantee of success, happiness, or even faint amusement. If you think these are going to make you rich, think again. Unless by "rich" you mean "rich in lessons learned," in which case, good luck.
* Use at Your Own Peril: By using The Configs, you acknowledge that you could end up with delightful gains, crushing losses, or maybe just a headache. If your portfolio does the financial equivalent of setting itself on fire, you may not sue me, my family, my pets, or even my neighbor’s goldfish. Seriously, leave the fish out of this.
* Permission to Do Whatever, Really: You are absolutely free to do anything you want with The Configs. Print them out and show them to your grandmother, share them on social media, frame them on your office wall for motivation (or as a cautionary tale). I truly do not care. If they end up in some hacker’s attic, well, that’s a story I’d love to hear someday.

**By proceeding beyond this point, you acknowledge and accept that your fate—glorious or disastrous—is in your own hands and you vow never to blame me for how it all shakes out. Enjoy, or don’t. Your call.**
